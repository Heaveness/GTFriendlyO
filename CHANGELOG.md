# Changelog

### **v1.1.1**
* Fixed a mistake on Shock Trooper's armor not reflecting the changes in v1.1.0.
* Fixed a few more typos again!

### v1.1.0

#### Player Tweaks:
* Decreased Player's base regen cap from `40% to 30%`
* Decreased Player's regen per second from `2.0 to 1.0`
* Decreased Player's sprinting speed from `65% to 60%`
* Decreased Player's walk step length from `2.5m to 2.0m`
* Decreased Player's sprint step length from `3.0m to 2.2m`
> Dev Note: I have noticed that some players were able to get away with a lot of situations simply because their regen cap and speed was forgiving enough when stacked with other regen-based boosters. Please keep in mind that these numbers are still higher than vanilla, it's just not as overtuned anymore.

#### Class Tweaks:
* Decreased **Shock Trooper's** Melee & Projectile Armor from `40% to 30%`
* Increased **Shock Trooper's** Movement Spd penalty from `-20% to -25%`
> Dev Note: While I am not a fan of simply nerfing without compensating, but there are few instances where I don't have a lot of options. Shock Trooper is just too good when stacking multiple bonuses.

#### Weapon Tweaks:
* Decreased maximum ammo capacity for **Explosive Shrapnel Rifle** from `103 to 80`
* Decreased reload time for **Explosive Shrapnel Rifle** from `4.2s to 3.8s`
* Decreased maximum ammo capacity for **Explosive Shrapnel Cannon** from `65 to 50`
* Decreased reload time for **Explosive Shrapnel Cannon** from `4.5s to 4.0s`
* Decreased maximum ammo capacity for **Explosive Shotgun** from `49 to 30`
* Decreased bullet damage of **Explosive Shotgun** from `1.0 to 0.5`
* Decreased bullet damage of **Triple Barrel Shotgun** from `5.5 to 5.0`
* Decreased maximum ammo capacity for **W-pen Sniper Rifle** from `24 to 20`
* Decreased reload time for **W-pen Sniper Rifle** from `5.0s to 4.3s`
* Decreased maximum ammo capacity for **Gauss Rifle** from `48 to 40`
* Increased maximum ammo capacity for **Tracker Precision Rifle** from `91 to 98`
* Increased maximum ammo capacity for **Choke Mod Shotgun** from `49 to 54`
* Increased maximum ammo capacity for **Pump Action Shotgun** from `55 to 58`

> Dev Note: Some weapons were overperforming because their max ammo cap was a bit too high. In some rundowns where ammo was plenty, this allowed some weapons to outshine other guns in almost every situation. Unfortunately, this led to other players feeling less impactful within the team.

#### Tool Tweaks:
* Increased detection range of **Burst Sentry** from `25.0m to 40.0m`
* Decreased detection angle of **Shotgun Sentry** from `70.0 to 60.0`
* Increased detection range of **Shotgun Sentry** from `10.0m to 15.0m`
* Increased detection angle of **Auto Sentry** from `50.0 to 60.0`
* Increased detection range of **Burst Sentry** from `25.0m to 40.0m`
* Added **Burst Sentry** ability to do backstab damage.
> Dev Note: Fixed a few awkward attributes regarding the Sentries.

#### Melee Tweaks:
* Decreased range of Melee **Sledgehammers** from `3.0m to 2.3m`
* Decreased range of Melee **Knives** from `2.0m to 1.9m`
* Decreased range of Melee **Spears** from `4.0m to 3.5m`
* Decreased range of Melee **Bats** from `2.25m to 2.0m`
* Decreased base stamina cost of **Sledgehammer** in combat from `0.4 to 0.35`
* Decreased base stamina cost of **Sledgehammer** out of combat from `0.4 to 0.3`
> Dev Note: The new melee ranges might have been overtuned which made the visual feedback between the perspective and actual damage awkward. It is still overall higher than vanilla range, but as much as before.

#### Enemy Tweaks:
* Decreased knockback velocity of **Tank's** tentacle attacks from `12.0 to 10.0`
* Increased bleed damage interval from `0.5s to 1.0s.` (total damage went from `10%` to `5%` over the duration) 
> Dev Note: Tweaked two abilities down to allow for players a bit more avenue for counterplay.

#### Miscellaneous:
* Fixed a little bit more typos here and there.
> Dev Note: Final note regarding the overall vibe of this balance patch. While it's an overall nerf to the many things, keep in mind that this will incentize teams to emphasizing on their strengths while compensating for each other's weaknesses. The pack's goal is to make the experience more accessible, but don't remove all of the difficulty and challenge of the base game.
